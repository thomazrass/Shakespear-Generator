# Shakespear-Generator
In the files, there are the Jupiter notebooks, where I documented some tests and where I learnt the majority of what was used in this project. The model is built, trained,and exported in the model.py file. In generate.py, the model is imported and used to generate Shakespearian style text. You can chose whether or not you want the model to be trained using character tokenization or word tokenization, which is much longer to train. Since I did not have enough ressources, the current model was only trained on a character-level basis. 

I did not rely on OpenAI, nor the OpenAI API to make this project possible.
